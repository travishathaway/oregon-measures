Oregon Measures
===============

Oregon Measures is a simple application that shows the results of ballot measure initiatives in Oregon from 1996 til 2016 except for years 2007 (special election year) and 2002.  I am still on the hunt for this data.  The application consists of two parts; a React JS app for displaying the data and a Python CLI program for processing of data.
